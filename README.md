# Portfolio-Website

My new portfolio website because my old one was a mess.
<br>
This is hosted on Netlify.

## Hosting on Netlify
This gave me a lot of pain because I didn't know how hosting on Netlify worked.
<br>
- Resources:
    - [Netlify framework integrations documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/)
    - [Netlify hosting tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKC70r3xbKU)
- Tips:
    - **READ THE DOCUMENTATION**
    - When importing a repository from Github, Netlify will automatically detect Next.js projects and install the corresponding tools for them
    - `Deploys > Build & Deploy > Build Settings` is your friend. [Common Next.js build configuration](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/#next-js)
